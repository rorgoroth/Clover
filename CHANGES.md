>[!WARNING]
>About `Posting from your IP range has been temporarily blocked due to abuse`.
>

>I do not know if the recent Clover changes to the captcha are at the origin of this ban due to the way the captcha was constructed.
>The changes in this version should prevent this going forward. My apologies.\
>If you get this message and still want to post for now the best solution is to verify your email.
>Keep in mind when you receive the email that it needs to be opened WITHIN Clover (use the option *Enter verification token*), not your regular browser.\
